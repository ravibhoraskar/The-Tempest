8. Points to discuss for afterlives: dismissal of caliban, and making ariel a willing slave by charles lamb; depiction of caliban in the graphic novel - can't evoke sympathy(?); contemporary events of shakespeare's times - discuss genearlly, and also w.r.t. the wake
9. the wake - prospero as an image of shakespeare - renouncing magic
